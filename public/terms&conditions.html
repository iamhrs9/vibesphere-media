        <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 02, 2026</p>

        <p>Welcome to <strong>VibeSphere Media</strong> ("Company", "We", "Us", or "Our"). By accessing our website, purchasing our services, or engaging in any business transaction with us, you ("Client", "User", "You") agree to comply with and be bound by the following Terms and Conditions.</p>

        <h2>1. Scope of Services</h2>
        <p>VibeSphere Media provides digital marketing, web development, branding, and video editing services. The specific deliverables for each project will be outlined in the respective package description or a custom proposal agreed upon by both parties.</p>

        <h2>2. Payments & Invoicing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Advance Payment:</strong> All standard packages require 100% advance payment via our secure payment gateway (Razorpay/UPI/Cashfree).</li>
            <li><strong>Custom Projects:</strong> For custom projects exceeding ₹50,000, a 50% non-refundable deposit is required to commence work, with the remaining balance due upon project completion but before final delivery.</li>
            <li><strong>Taxes:</strong> All prices mentioned are exclusive of GST unless stated otherwise. Applicable taxes will be added during checkout.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Client Obligations</h2>
        <p>To ensure timely delivery, the Client agrees to provide all necessary assets (logos, content, credentials, images) within <strong>3 working days</strong> of project commencement. Delays caused by the Client’s failure to provide assets will result in a corresponding extension of the delivery timeline.</p>

        <h2>4. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
        <p>Upon full payment, the Client will own the rights to the final exported deliverables (e.g., final video files, website code). However, VibeSphere Media retains the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the work in our portfolio, website, and social media for promotional purposes.</li>
            <li>Retain ownership of underlying tools, frameworks, and pre-existing templates used to create the deliverables.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Revisions & Modifications</h2>
        <p>Standard packages include a specific number of revisions (as mentioned in the package details). Additional revisions beyond the agreed scope will be charged at our standard hourly rate of <strong>₹1,500/hour</strong>.</p>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We may use third-party tools (e.g., Hosting, Domains, paid plugins, stock footage) to fulfill services. Costs for these third-party services are the responsibility of the Client unless explicitly included in the package price.</p>

        <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>VibeSphere Media shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, data, or business reputation, arising from the use of our services. We do not guarantee specific results (e.g., exact number of sales or followers) as digital marketing outcomes depend on market conditions.</p>

        <h2>8. Confidentiality</h2>
        <p>Both parties agree to keep all proprietary information, trade secrets, and login credentials exchanged during the project strictly confidential and will not disclose them to third parties without prior consent.</p>

        <h2>9. Termination</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to terminate services immediately if the Client engages in abusive behavior, fails to make payments, or demands services outside the legal scope. In such cases, no refunds will be issued for work already completed.</p>

        <h2>10. Governing Law & Jurisdiction</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of <strong>India</strong>. Any disputes arising out of this agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in <strong>Rajasthan, India</strong>.</p>

        <h2>11. Contact Information</h2>
        <p>For any legal concerns or clarifications regarding these Terms, please contact us at:</p>
