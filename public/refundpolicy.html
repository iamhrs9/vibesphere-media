        <h1>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 02, 2026</p>

        <p>At <strong>VibeSphere Media</strong>, we strive to provide high-quality digital services. However, due to the nature of digital goods and services, our Refund and Cancellation Policy is strict to ensure fair compensation for the time and resources invested by our team.</p>

        <h2>1. Cancellation Policy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Before Project Initiation:</strong> Clients may cancel their order within <strong>24 hours</strong> of payment, provided that the onboarding process or work has not yet commenced. In this case, a 100% refund will be issued.</li>
            <li><strong>After Project Initiation:</strong> Once the team has started working on the project (e.g., design drafts created, campaign setup initiated), <strong>no cancellations</strong> will be accepted.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Refund Eligibility</h2>
        <p>Refunds are generally NOT provided for digital marketing services, web development, or video editing once the work has begun. However, exceptions may be made under the following specific circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Non-Delivery of Service:</strong> If VibeSphere Media fails to deliver the agreed-upon service within the specified timeline (excluding delays caused by the Client), a full or partial refund may be issued.</li>
            <li><strong>Duplicate Payment:</strong> If a Client accidentally pays twice for the same invoice, the duplicate amount will be refunded immediately.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="alert-box">
            <strong>Note:</strong> Refunds will NOT be granted based on "change of mind," "personal taste," or "market performance" (e.g., low ad conversions), as these factors are influenced by external market conditions.
        </div>

        <h2>3. Non-Refundable Items</h2>
        <p>The following items are strictly non-refundable under any circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Third-party costs incurred on behalf of the client (e.g., Domain Names, Hosting Fees, Premium Plugin Licenses).</li>
            <li>Ad Budgets paid directly to platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or Google.</li>
            <li>Consultation fees for time already spent in meetings/strategy sessions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Chargebacks & Disputes</h2>
        <p>Clients agree to contact VibeSphere Media support to resolve any billing issues before initiating a chargeback with their bank. Raising a chargeback without prior communication will be considered a breach of contract, and we reserve the right to suspend all services and pursue legal action to recover disputed funds.</p>

        <h2>5. Refund Process & Timeline</h2>
        <p>To request a refund, please email us at <strong>billing@vibespheremedia.in</strong> with your Order ID and a detailed reason for the request. Our team will review the claim within 48 hours.</p>
        <p>If approved, the refund will be processed to the original payment method within <strong>5-7 business days</strong>. The time taken for the amount to reflect in your bank account depends on your bank's processing speed.</p>
